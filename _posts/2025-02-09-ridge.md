[In the last article](https://piinghel.github.io/quant/2024/12/15/low-volatility-factor.html), by scaling returns based on volatility, we improved performance with minimal complexity. But what if we could do better?

This time, we’ll predict stock rankings using a linear regression model that combines multiple features—like price changes, trading volume, and risk levels—and learns the optimal ranking based on a target label. A target label is simply the outcome we want the model to predict, such as stock returns or Sharpe ratio. By learning to predict this label, the model will rank the stocks accordingly.

Predicting stock rankings isn’t as simple as it seems. We’re dealing with features on different scales—price changes, trading volume, risk—and if we don’t normalize them, bigger features like market cap will overshadow smaller ones, like short-term returns. Additionally, the signal-to-noise ratio is quite low, meaning there’s a lot of random fluctuation in the data, which makes it harder for the model to find meaningful patterns. My intuition tells me normalizing these features will help the model learn a better ranking. I’m not totally sure yet, but that’s exactly what I’m testing today. If we get the normalization right, the model might perform better—but we’ll see.

The dataset stays the same as the one used in [the previous article](https://piinghel.github.io/quant/2024/12/15/low-volatility-factor.html): daily price, volume, and market capitalization data for all Russell 1000 (RIY) constituents, covering about 3,300 stocks historically. We use point-in-time constituents of the RIY and apply basic liquidity filters, excluding stocks priced below $5 to ensure realistic implementation.



## Feature Engineering

Coming from a statistical and computer science background, it makes sense to let the data figure out how the relationships should be learned, instead of imposing too many assumptions. This contrasts with the typical approach in multifactor portfolios, where the modeler decides how features should be combined. The advantage of using a regression model is that it learns the weights for how features should be combined. We’re sticking with linear regression for now, assuming the relationships are linear and no interaction terms. It’s a simple, data-driven approach that focuses on finding those direct, linear connections between features and the target.

Obviously, we need to define our predictive features and choose a target variable. We focus on price, volume, market capitalization, and market-derived features. Below is a breakdown of the main feature groups, computed daily for all 3,300 stocks in our universe.  

1. **Momentum Features**  
   - Capture trend-following behavior.  
   - Examples:  
     - Lagged returns over 1 to 10 days.  
     - Rolling cumulative returns over 21 to 252 days.  
     - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to detect shifts in momentum.  

2. **Volatility Features**  
   - Measure risk.  
   - Examples:  
     - Rolling historical volatility over 21, 63, or 126 days.  
     - Separate downside and upside volatility.  
     - Average True Range (ATR) to normalize price fluctuations.  

3. **Liquidity Features**  
   - Assess trading activity.  
   - Examples:  
     - Rolling mean and standard deviation of trading volume.  
     - Ratio of current volume to its rolling maximum to highlight unusual trading activity.  

4. **Size Features**  
   - Measure company scale.  
   - Examples:  
     - Rolling mean and minimum of market cap.  
     - Distinguishes small-cap from large-cap stocks.  

5. **Short Mean Reversion Features**  
   - Identify when prices revert to historical norms.  
   - Examples:  
     - Price deviation from its rolling moving average.  
     - Position relative to rolling minimum and maximum values.  
     - Bollinger Bands to spot overbought or oversold conditions.  

6. **Correlation with the Market**  
   - Capture systematic risk.  
   - Examples:  
     - Rolling correlation with the Russell 1000 over 63-day windows.  
     - Helps separate defensive stocks from high-beta names.  

That leaves us with around 150 predictive features, some of which are obviously correlated.  

### Target Variable
Now, what exactly are we trying to predict? We’ll focus on two targets:  

- Return over the next 20 days  
- Sharpe ratio over the next 20 days  

Could we explore other horizons? Sure. But to keep things simple, we’ll stick to 20 days for now.  


## Preprocessing: Cross-Sectional Normalizaton  

 
To help the model learn more effectively, we apply cross-sectional normalization. This means adjusting each feature relative to all other stocks on the same day so the model can focus on relative differences rather than raw values.  

Stock features vary widely—some, like market cap, are in the billions, while others, like daily returns, are much smaller. The model will still work without normalization, but when features are on vastly different scales, it can make it harder to learn relationships effectively.  

Cross-sectional normalization helps with stationarity, stabilizing the data and ensuring the model focuses on how features relate to each other rather than their absolute values. This improves ranking consistency across time.  

### Mathematical Formulation  

For a given feature $X^p$, the normalized value for stock $i$ at time $t$ is:  

$$
X^{p,\text{norm}}_{i,t} = f(X^p_{i,t}, X^p_{1:N,t})
$$  

where:  
- $X^p_{i,t}$ is the raw feature value for stock $i$ at time $t$.  
- $X^p_{1:N,t}$ is the set of values for all stocks at time $t$ for feature $p$.  
- $f(\cdot)$ is the chosen normalization method.  

### Z-Scoring  

Z-scoring standardizes features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1:  

$$
X^{p,\text{norm}}_{i,t} = \frac{X^p_{i,t} - \mu^p_t}{\sigma^p_t}
$$  

where:  
- $\mu^p_t$ is the mean across all stocks at time $t$ for feature $p$:  

  $$
  \mu^p_t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X^p_{i,t}
  $$  

- $\sigma^p_t$ is the standard deviation:  

  $$
  \sigma^p_t = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (X^p_{i,t} - \mu^p_t)^2}
  $$  

To prevent extreme values from distorting results, any outliers beyond ±5 standard deviations are clipped.  

### Ranking Normalization  

Instead of standardizing, we rank stocks and scale the ranks between 0 and 1:  

$$
R^p_{i,t} = \frac{r^p_{i,t}}{N}
$$  

where:  
- $r^p_{i,t}$ is the rank of stock $i$ at time $t$ based on feature $p$ (0 for the lowest value, $N$ for the highest).  
- $R^p_{i,t}$ is the normalized rank.  

This approach transforms a feature into a uniform distribution over $[0,1]$, ensuring all features are comparable while preserving their relative rankings.  


## Testing Whether Normalization Helps  

The model does not require normalization to function—it will still produce rankings using raw features. The question is whether normalization leads to better rankings.  

Three approaches are tested where all features, including the target label, are normalized the same way:  

1. No normalization (raw features)  
2. Z-scoring across all stocks  
3. Ranking across all stocks  

If normalization improves performance, the next step is to examine whether the target label should be normalized globally or by sector.  

## Should the Target Label Be Normalized by Sector?  

After evaluating the effect of normalization on all features, the focus shifts to the target label (Return 20 or Sharpe Ratio 20). The question is whether it should be normalized across all stocks or within each sector.  

- **Global normalization** applies normalization to the target label across all stocks in the universe.  
- **Sector-specific normalization** applies normalization to the target label separately within each sector, while all other features remain globally normalized.  

This adjustment ensures that stocks are normalized within their sector rather than compared to the entire market. The objective is to determine whether this sector-based normalization of the target label improves ranking performance.  

 Below, in Figure 1, different normalization methods are applied to a single feature (20-day return). From left to right: the original distribution, z-scored, and ranked.  

![Figure 1](/assets/ridge/example_normalization.png)  

**Figure 1**: Effect of normalization on 20-day return distribution. Left: Original data, Middle: Z-scored, Right: Ranked between 0 and 1.  


### Handling Missing Data  

Stock data isn’t always perfect—sometimes values are missing. The model can still run without them, but leaving gaps in the data isn’t ideal. So how do we fill them in?  

We keep it simple:  

- Forward fill: If a stock has prior data, we use the last known value.  
- Cross-sectional mean imputation: If no past data exists, we replace the missing value with the sector average for that day.  
- Default values: If neither of the above works, we apply:  
  - Z-scoring: Missing values are set to 0.  
  - Ranking: Missing values are set to 0.5 (midpoint of the ranking scale).  

Could we get more sophisticated? Absolutely. There are plenty of ways to handle missing data, from advanced statistical methods to ML-based imputations. But for now, I'm sticking with a simple, reliable approach.  A deeper dive into missing data strategies is a topic for another time.


## Modeling the Cross-Sectional Normalized Score

At the core of this strategy, I’m building a model to predict a stock's cross-sectional normalized score, which could be its Sharpe ratio, return, or another performance measure. I think of this as a function mapping available information at time $t$ to an expected score at $t+1$. To ensure comparability across stocks, the score is normalized in the cross-section before modeling.

Mathematically, I assume that there exists a function $g(\cdot)$ such that:

$$
s_{i,t+1} = g(\mathbf{z}_{i,t}) + \epsilon_{i,t+1}
$$  

where:
- $s_{i,t+1}$ is the true cross-sectional normalized score for stock $i$ at time $t+1$.
- $z_{i,t}$ is a vector of predictor variables for stock $i$ at time $t$.
- $\epsilon_{i,t+1}$ is the error term, representing what the model cannot predict.

The objective is to approximate $g(\cdot)$ using historical data. This function follows two key principles:

 - it leverage the entire panel of stocks, meaning the same functional form applies universally.
 - It depends only on stock-specific features at time $t$. While some features contain past information (such as return over the past 20 days), these are explicitly engineered rather than dynamically learned. In addition, the model does not learn interactions between different stocks.

### Ridge Regression as a Baseline

To estimate $g(\cdot)$, I use Ridge Regression, a simple yet effective baseline, particularly when predictors are highly correlated. It solves the following optimization problem:

$$
\underset{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\min} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (s_{i,t+1} - \mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2
$$

where the second term, $\lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2$, regularizes the coefficients to prevent instability.

Ridge is a reasonable choice here because:
- Stocks with similar characteristics often exhibit collinearity, and Ridge helps stabilize coefficient estimates.
- The regularization term shrinks extreme values, reducing sensitivity to noise.
- It provides a simple reference point before exploring more complex models.

The model is estimated using historical data, and to assess its effectiveness, I apply an expanding walkforward validation which I explain just below in a bit more detail.

## Expanding Walkforward Validation  

To see how well the model holds up over time, I use an expanding walkforward validation. The idea is simple:  

1. Start with a 3-year burn-in period – The model isn’t tested yet; it just learns from the data.  
2. Update the model every 2 years – Each time, I add the latest data and refit the model.  
3. Keep expanding the dataset – Older data stays in, and new data gets added.  

With stock data, I’ve always found that the more historical data, the better. The signal-to-noise ratio is low, so keeping as much information as possible helps the model the find the signal in all the noise.  

A rolling validation window could be an alternative, but it discards older data that might still be valuable. In my experience, an expanding window works better because it allows the model to pick up long-term relationships, leading to more stable predictions.  

For hyperparameter tuning, one option is to split the training set into separate train and validation sets. But honestly, I’ve never found this to be worth the extra time. Optimizing hyperparameters can take a while, and in most cases, default values that make sense are already a very good starting point.  

Below is a schematic of the expanding walkforward approach:  

![Figure 2](/assets/ridge/walk-forward.png)  

**Figure 2**: Expanding walkforward validation process.  


## Portfolio Construction


Once I have stock rankings, I build a long-short portfolio:  

- I go long on the 75 stocks with the highest scores.  
- I short the 75 stocks with the lowest scores.  

The approach is robust across different portfolio sizes, whether using 50, 100, or 150 stocks.  

To keep risk under control, I use volatility targeting:  
- Higher-volatility stocks get smaller weights.  
- Lower-volatility stocks get larger weights.  

This ensures that the portfolio maintains a stable risk profile instead of being dominated by a few volatile names.  

For a deeper dive into my portfolio construction process, check out my [previous article](https://piinghel.github.io/quant/2024/12/15/low-volatility-factor.html) where I go into more detail.  
 
## Results  
To evaluate different modeling choices, I tested 10 model variations, combining:  
- 5 normalization methods: Raw, Z-score (global & sector), Ranking (global & sector).  
- 2 target labels: Sharpe Ratio (SR 20) and Return (Return 20).  
- A combined strategy ("Combo"), which equally weights all strategies.  

To ensure a fair comparison, all strategies were scaled to 8% volatility. The goal was to understand how normalization, sector adjustments, and target labels affect performance. Figure 3 visualizes cumulative returns across all strategies—without labels, adding a bit of suspense.  

While all models delivered positive returns, there were clear differences in performance.  

![Figure 3](/assets/ridge/all_lines.png)  

**Figure 3**: Cumulative returns of all strategies, scaled to 8% volatility.  

Figure 4 provides a summary of how normalization method, sector adjustment, and target label choice affected Sharpe Ratios across all models. It highlights the performance differences between Z-scoring, ranking, and raw features, as well as the impact of normalizing within sectors versus globally. The results also show how using Sharpe Ratios as a target label compares to using raw returns.  

One of the strongest patterns in the results is the impact of normalization. Models using Z-scoring performed best, followed by ranking, while raw features consistently underperformed. This was surprising—I initially expected ranking to work better due to its stabilizing effect. However, it seems that ranking may also remove valuable signals, which could explain why Z-scoring outperformed. As expected, raw features introduced too much noise, making them the weakest option.  

Beyond normalization type, sector adjustments had an even greater effect. Normalizing the target label within sectors significantly improved Sharpe Ratios, reinforcing the idea that comparing stock performance within their peer group leads to better rankings. Each sector has its own dynamics, and normalizing within them helps separate true signals from sector-wide noise. This adjustment ensures that comparisons remain meaningful, making rankings more robust.  

Target label choice also played a key role. Models trained on Sharpe Ratios outperformed those trained on raw returns, highlighting the advantage of using a risk-adjusted measure. This makes sense—predicting volatility is generally easier than predicting raw returns, which may explain why Sharpe Ratio models performed better across different setups.

### Normalization Effects Depend on the Target Label  

Looking at Figure 5, the effect of normalization depends on the target label.  

For Return 20 models, normalization had a smaller effect, but ranking and Z-scoring still outperformed raw features. Interestingly, Z-scoring has regained popularity in recent years.  

For Sharpe Ratio models, the impact of normalization was stronger. Z-scoring was clearly the best performer, followed by ranking, then raw features.

### Key Takeaways  
- Normalization improves signal stability, helping models generalize better.  
- Sector-based adjustments on the target label refine comparisons, preventing large sector-specific biases.  
- Target label choice affects robustness, with Sharpe Ratio-based models performing better.  

## The "Combo" Strategy Holds Up Well  

One surprising result: the "Combo" strategy performed exceptionally well (see table 1). Instead of picking a single best model, it equally weights all strategies—yet still ranked second overall in Sharpe Ratio.  

Even without fine-tuning, blending multiple signals smoothed performance and improved stability. This suggests that diversification across models can outperform an individual "best" model.

## Final Thoughts  

Sector normalization (target label), normalization method, and target label choice all had a meaningful impact on performance:  
- Sector normalization was a game-changer—comparing stocks within their sector led to major improvements.  
- Normalization method mattered more than expected—Z-scoring outperformed ranking, contradicting my initial intuition.  
- Sharpe Ratio models consistently outperformed return-based models, reinforcing the importance of risk-adjusted metrics.  

Instead of searching for a single best model, it may be smarter to combine perspectives. The "Combo" strategy showed that diversification across models stabilizes results—even without fine-tuning.  


## TOOD:
 - refer to combo in tabel
 - interpration a bit better
 - also say that things are scaled to all the same vol
 - make it a bit more personalized
 - go a bit more in depth about zscoring and ranking
 - not happy about sector should the target label be done by sector or gloablly. The transition it weird
 - Discuss the effects of ranking and zscoring a bit more 
 - Add some numbers in the text
 - Go a little bit deeper on why things works: Sharpe ratio because of the volatility, sector comparisoin. A lot of it is just a tradeoff between removing noise, adding simple making it simpler for the model
