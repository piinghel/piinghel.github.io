## Roadmap

This is just a running list of articles, papers, and blog posts I’ve found interesting — mostly around cross-sectional asset pricing, machine learning models, and quant investing. I’ll keep adding to it over time as I go deeper.

Some of this is academic, some more hands-on.


### Machine Learning + Asset Pricing

- **[Artificial Intelligence Asset Pricing Models](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5103546)**  
  *Bryan T. Kelly, Boris Kuznetsov, Semyon Malamud, Teng Andrea Xu (2025)*  
  - Uses transformers to directly learn the stochastic discount factor from raw panel data. A step toward end-to-end portfolio optimization.

- **[Building Cross-Sectional Systematic Strategies by Learning to Rank](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3751012)**  
  *Daniel Poh, Bryan Lim, Stefan Zohren, Stephen Roberts (2021)*  
  - Applies learning-to-rank techniques to directly optimize for cross-sectional ordering instead of predicting returns. Tightly aligned with how quant signals are actually used.

### Return Predictability

- **[Global Return Predictability](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=)**  
  *Lasse Heje Pedersen*  
  - Framework for understanding global return predictability across markets and asset classes.

### Risk Management

- **[Risk Everywhere: Modeling and Managing Volatility](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Working-Paper/Risk-Everywhere-Modeling-and-Managing-Volatility)**  
  *Tim Bollerslev, Benjamin Hood, John Huss, Lasse Heje Pedersen*  
  - Examines realized volatility patterns across 50+ commodities, currencies, equity indices, and fixed-income instruments. Uses panel-based estimation to achieve superior out-of-sample risk forecasts.



More coming soon — this is my scratchpad for everything worth revisiting.
