## Roadmap

This is just a running list of articles, papers, and blog posts I’ve found interesting — mostly around cross-sectional asset pricing, machine learning models, and quant investing. I’ll keep adding to it over time as I go deeper.

Some of this is academic, some more hands-on. Occasionally I might throw in stuff that’s not directly trading-related but still sparked something for me.


### Machine Learning + Asset Pricing

- **[Artificial Intelligence Asset Pricing Models](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5103546)**  
  *Bryan T. Kelly, Boris Kuznetsov, Semyon Malamud, Teng Andrea Xu (2025)*  
  - Uses transformers to directly learn the stochastic discount factor from raw panel data. A step toward end-to-end portfolio optimization.

- **[Building Cross-Sectional Systematic Strategies by Learning to Rank](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3751012)**  
  *Daniel Poh, Bryan Lim, Stefan Zohren, Stephen Roberts (2021)*  
  - Applies learning-to-rank techniques to directly optimize for cross-sectional ordering instead of predicting returns. Tightly aligned with how quant signals are actually used.



More coming soon — this is my scratchpad for everything worth revisiting.
