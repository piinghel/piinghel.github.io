Hi, I’m Pieter-Jan. I’m a quant researcher who’s all about diving into markets, data, and systematic strategies. Over the years, I’ve worked on machine learning for long/short equity, trend following, and portfolio optimization.

This blog is where I share whatever’s on my mind—insights, experiments, or anything that’s caught my interest. Expect to see a lot about trading, data, and machine learning. If any of that resonates with you, I hope you find something here worth reading.

Feel free to connect with me via [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/PieterJanInghelbrecht) or drop me an email at [**pjinghelbrecht@gmail.com**](mailto:pjinghelbrecht@gmail.com).
