<ul>
  <li>update with new data</li>
  <li>reread + spelling and style.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://piinghel.github.io/quant/2024/12/15/low-volatility-factor.html">In the last article</a>, I showed how scaling returns by volatility helped improve performance with minimal complexity. This time, I want to take a more data-driven approach—one where the model learns how to combine different features instead of me setting the rules manually.</p>

<p>Stock prediction is hard. Instead of trying to guess exact returns, I’m focusing on something more practical: figuring out whether stock A will perform better than stock B. I don’t need to know by how much—just which one is likely to do better.</p>

<p>To do this, I’m using a multiple linear regression model that takes in many features—like price changes, trading volume, and risk levels—and learns how to weigh them optimally. The model is trained on a target label, which is just the outcome I want it to predict, like future returns or the Sharpe ratio.</p>

<p>But there are a few challenges. Features behave differently over time—their distributions shift, patterns that worked before can break down, and some signals that seem useful in one market environment might completely disappear in another. On top of that, the signal-to-noise ratio is low, making it tough to extract meaningful insights.</p>

<p>The dataset stays the same as the one used in <a href="https://piinghel.github.io/quant/2024/12/15/low-volatility-factor.html">the previous article</a>: daily price, volume, and market capitalization data for all Russell 1000 (RIY) constituents, covering about 3,300 stocks historically. We use point-in-time constituents of the RIY and apply basic liquidity filters, excluding stocks priced below $5 to ensure realistic implementation.</p>

<h2 id="feature-engineering">Feature Engineering</h2>

<p>Coming from a statistical and computer science background, I naturally lean toward letting the data determine relationships rather than imposing rigid assumptions. This contrasts with traditional multifactor portfolio approaches, where the modeler manually decides how to combine features (factors). Instead, I use a regression model that learns the optimal feature weights directly from the data.</p>

<p>For now, I’m keeping it simple with linear regression, assuming the relationships are linear and avoiding interaction terms. It’s a straightforward, data-driven approach that focuses on identifying direct, linear connections between features and the target variable.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-predictive-features">Choosing Predictive Features</h2>
<p>Before the model can learn anything useful, I define the right features and select a target variable. I focus on price, volume, market capitalization, and market-derived indicators, computing them daily for all 3,300 stocks in my universe. Here’s a breakdown of the key feature groups:</p>

<p><strong>1. Momentum Features</strong><br />
Capture trend-following behavior.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lagged returns over 1 to 10 days.</li>
  <li>Rolling cumulative returns over 21 to 252 days.</li>
  <li>MACD to detect shifts in momentum.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Volatility Features</strong><br />
Measure risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rolling historical volatility over 21, 63, or 126 days.</li>
  <li>Average True Range (ATR) to normalize price fluctuations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Liquidity Features</strong><br />
Assess trading activity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rolling mean and standard deviation of trading volume.</li>
  <li>Ratio of current volume to its rolling maximum to highlight unusual trading activity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Size Features</strong><br />
Measure company scale.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rolling mean and minimum of market cap.</li>
  <li>Distinguishes small-cap from large-cap stocks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Short Mean Reversion Features</strong><br />
Identify when prices revert to historical norms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Price deviation from its rolling moving average.</li>
  <li>Position relative to rolling minimum and maximum values.</li>
  <li>Bollinger Bands to spot overbought or oversold conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Correlation with the Market</strong><br />
Capture systematic risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rolling correlation with the Russell 1000 over 63-day windows.</li>
  <li>Helps separate defensive stocks from high-beta names.</li>
</ul>

<p>In total, I work with around 150 predictive features, obviously many of which are correlated.</p>

<h2 id="target-variable">Target Variable</h2>
<p>The model is trained to predict return over the next 20 days and Sharpe ratio over the next 20 days. While other time horizons could be explored, I’m keeping it simple and focusing on 20 days for now.</p>

<h2 id="preprocessing-cross-sectional-normalization">Preprocessing: Cross-Sectional Normalization</h2>

<p>Cross-sectional normalization adjusts each feature relative to all other stocks on the same day, ensuring the model focuses on relative differences rather than absolute values. This transformation also makes interpretation easier—when features are normalized consistently, it becomes simpler to identify high or low values over time.</p>

<p>By applying this normalization, I make sure stocks are evaluated on a comparable basis at each point in time. This should help the model focus on learning the relative order of stocks rather than absolute levels, while also preventing certain features from disproportionately influencing the predictions.</p>

<h2 id="mathematical-formulation">Mathematical Formulation</h2>

<p>For a given feature $X^p$, the normalized value for stock $i$ at time $t$ is:</p>

\[X_{i,t}^{p,\text{norm}} = f\left(X_{i,t}^{p}, X_{1:N,t}^{p}\right)\]

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X^p_{i,t}$ is the raw feature value for stock $i$ at time $t$.</li>
  <li>$X^p_{1:N,t}$ is the set of values for all stocks at time $t$ for feature $p$.</li>
  <li>$f(\cdot)$ is the chosen normalization method.</li>
</ul>

<p>Different methods can be used to transform the raw values, each with its own strengths and tradeoffs. I’ll be comparing Z-scoring and ranking sometimes also called uniformization.</p>

<h2 id="z-scoring">Z-Scoring</h2>

<p>One common approach is z-scoring, which standardizes features by centering them around zero and scaling them to have a standard deviation of one:</p>

\[X_{i,t}^{p,\text{norm}} = \frac{X_{i,t}^{p} - \hat{\mu}^p_t}{\hat{\sigma}^p_t}\]

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>$\hat{\mu}^p_t$ is the estimated mean across all stocks at time $t$ for feature $p$:</p>

\[\hat{\mu}^p_t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i,t}^{p}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>$\hat{\sigma}^p_t$ is the estimated standard deviation:</p>

\[\hat{\sigma}^p_t = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( X_{i,t}^{p} - \hat{\mu}^p_t \right)^2}\]
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Z-scoring retains the relative magnitudes of the original values, allowing the model to distinguish between small and large variations. However, it is sensitive to extreme outliers, so values beyond ±5 standard deviations are clipped.</p>

<h2 id="ranking-normalization">Ranking Normalization</h2>

<p>Another approach is ranking normalization which transforms feature values into ranks and scales them between 0 and 1:</p>

\[R_{i,t}^{p} = \frac{r_{i,t}^{p}}{N}\]

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$r^p_{i,t}$ is the rank of stock $i$ at time $t$ based on feature $p$ (0 for the lowest value, $N$ for the highest).</li>
  <li>$R^p_{i,t}$ is the normalized rank.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike z-scoring, ranking ensures that the distribution remains the same over time. This makes it robust to extreme values but removes magnitude information—only relative positioning is preserved.</p>

<h2 id="visualizing-the-effect-of-normalization">Visualizing the Effect of Normalization</h2>

<p>Below, in Figure 1, I summarize the different normalization methods applied to a single feature (20-day return). From left to right: the original distribution, z-scored, and ranked.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ridge/example_normalization.png" alt="Figure 1" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Effect of normalization on 20-day return distribution. Left: Original data, Middle: Z-scored, Right: Ranked between 0 and 1.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-normalization-method">Choosing the Right Normalization Method</h2>

<p>How I normalize features has a big impact on how the model interprets stock differences. The choice between z-scoring and ranking depends on what I want the model to focus on.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Z-scoring</strong> keeps magnitude differences intact, which helps when the strength of a signal matters. But it more sensitive to distribution shifts over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Ranking</strong> is more stable and removes extreme outliers since values are always mapped to a uniform distribution. However, this process also discards information about the magnitude of differences between stocks</li>
</ul>

<p>Both methods ensure that stocks are processed in a comparable way on any given day, but they emphasize different aspects of the data.</p>

<h2 id="evaluating-the-impact-of-normalization">Evaluating the Impact of Normalization</h2>

<p>To see if normalization improves results, I compare three approaches:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using raw, unnormalized features</li>
  <li>Applying z-scoring across all stocks</li>
  <li>Using ranking across all stocks</li>
</ol>

<p>If normalization improves performance, the next step is to refine how I apply it—especially to the target label.</p>

<h2 id="should-the-target-label-be-normalized-by-sector">Should the Target Label Be Normalized by Sector?</h2>

<p>Normalizing features ensures consistency over time, but what about the target label? Instead of normalizing returns across all stocks, I test whether normalizing them within each sector improves results while keeping all other features globally normalized.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global normalization</strong> applies the same normalization across the full stock universe.</li>
  <li><strong>Sector-specific normalization</strong> adjusts returns within each sector while keeping all other features globally normalized.</li>
</ul>

<p>My hypothesis is that sector-normalizing the target label might help by preventing cross-sector differences from distorting the model’s learning process. Stocks in different industries often have structurally different return profiles, so this adjustment could make return comparisons more meaningful. Whether this actually improves performance is something I aim to find out.</p>

<h2 id="handling-missing-data">Handling Missing Data</h2>

<p>Some models, like decision trees, handle missing data automatically, but others don’t. To keep things simple, I use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Forward fill:</strong> Use the last known value if past data exists.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-sectional mean imputation:</strong> If no past data is available, replace the missing value with the sector average for that day.</li>
  <li><strong>Default values:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>For z-scoring, set missing values to 0.</li>
      <li>For ranking, set missing values to 0.5 (midpoint of the ranking scale).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This approach is simple, effective, and works well for now.</p>

<h2 id="modeling-the-cross-sectional-normalized-score">Modeling the Cross-Sectional Normalized Score</h2>

<p>At the core of this strategy, I’m building a model to predict a stock’s cross-sectional normalized score, which could be its Sharpe ratio, return, or another performance measure. I think of this as a function mapping available information at time $t$ to an expected score at $t+1$. To ensure comparability across stocks, the score is normalized in the cross-section before modeling.</p>

<p>Mathematically, I assume that there exists a function $g(\cdot)$ such that:</p>

\[s_{i,t+1} = g(\mathbf{z}_{i,t}) + \epsilon_{i,t+1}\]

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$s_{i,t+1}$ is the true cross-sectional normalized score for stock $i$ at time $t+1$.</li>
  <li>$z_{i,t}$ is a vector of predictor variables for stock $i$ at time $t$.</li>
  <li>$\epsilon_{i,t+1}$ is the error term, representing what the model cannot predict.</li>
</ul>

<p>The objective is to approximate $g(\cdot)$ using historical data. This function follows two key principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it leverage the entire panel of stocks, meaning the same functional form applies universally.</li>
  <li>It depends only on stock-specific features at time $t$. While some features contain past information (such as return over the past 20 days), these are explicitly engineered rather than dynamically learned. In addition, the model does not learn interactions between different stocks.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ridge-regression-as-a-baseline">Ridge Regression as a Baseline</h3>

<p>To estimate $g(\cdot)$, I use Ridge Regression, a simple yet effective baseline, particularly when predictors are highly correlated. It solves the following optimization problem:</p>

\[\underset{\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\min} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (s_{i,t+1} - \mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2\]

<p>where the second term, $\lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2$, regularizes the coefficients to prevent instability.</p>

<p>Ridge is a reasonable choice here because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stocks with similar characteristics often exhibit collinearity, and Ridge helps stabilize coefficient estimates.</li>
  <li>The regularization term shrinks extreme values, reducing sensitivity to noise.</li>
  <li>It provides a simple reference point before exploring more complex models.</li>
</ul>

<p>The model is estimated using historical data, and to assess its effectiveness, I apply an expanding walkforward validation which I explain just below in a bit more detail.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-walkforward-validation">Expanding Walkforward Validation</h2>

<p>To see how well the model holds up over time, I use an expanding walkforward validation. The idea is simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with a 3-year burn-in period – The model isn’t tested yet; it just learns from the data.</li>
  <li>Update the model every 2 years – Each time, I add the latest data and refit the model.</li>
  <li>Keep expanding the dataset – Older data stays in, and new data gets added.</li>
</ol>

<p>With stock data, I’ve always found that the more historical data, the better. The signal-to-noise ratio is low, so keeping as much information as possible helps the model the find the signal in all the noise.</p>

<p>A rolling validation window could be an alternative, but it discards older data that might still be valuable. In my experience, an expanding window works better because it allows the model to pick up long-term relationships, leading to more stable predictions.</p>

<p>For hyperparameter tuning, one option is to split the training set into separate train and validation sets. But honestly, I’ve never found this to be worth the extra time. Optimizing hyperparameters can take a while, and in most cases, default values that make sense are already a very good starting point.</p>

<p>Below is a schematic of the expanding walkforward approach:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ridge/walk-forward.png" alt="Figure 2" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Expanding walkforward validation process.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-construction">Portfolio Construction</h2>

<p>Once I have stock rankings, I build a long-short portfolio:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I go long on the 75 stocks with the highest scores.</li>
  <li>I short the 75 stocks with the lowest scores.</li>
</ul>

<p>The approach is robust across different portfolio sizes, whether using 50, 100, or 150 stocks.</p>

<p>To keep risk under control, I use volatility targeting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Higher-volatility stocks get smaller weights.</li>
  <li>Lower-volatility stocks get larger weights.</li>
</ul>

<p>This ensures that the portfolio maintains a stable risk profile instead of being dominated by a few volatile names.</p>

<p>For a deeper dive into my portfolio construction process, check out my <a href="https://piinghel.github.io/quant/2024/12/15/low-volatility-factor.html">previous article</a> where I go into more detail.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>To evaluate different modeling choices, I tested 10 model variations, combining:</p>
<ul>
  <li>5 normalization methods: Raw, Z-score (global &amp; sector), Ranking (global &amp; sector).</li>
  <li>2 target labels: Sharpe Ratio (SR 20) and Return (Return 20).</li>
  <li>A combined strategy (“Combo”), which equally weights all strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure a fair comparison visually, all strategies are scaled to 10% volatility. The goal is to understand how normalization, sector adjustments, and target labels affect performance. Figure 3 visualizes cumulative returns across all strategies—without labels, adding a bit of suspense.</p>

<p>While all models deliver positive returns, there is a clear differences in performance.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ridge/all_lines.png" alt="Figure 3" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Cumulative returns of all strategies, scaled to 10% volatility.</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows how different normalization methods, sector adjustments, and target label choices affect Sharpe Ratios across the models. It compares Z-scoring, raw features, and ranking, and also looks at the effect of normalizing within sectors versus globally. Plus, it shows how using Sharpe Ratios or raw returns as the target label changes things.</p>

<p>First off, normalization is pretty clear—Z-scoring works best, then ranking, and raw features consistently underperform. I was honestly expecting ranking to be the top performer because it’s supposed to stabilize things, but it seems like it might also take out some useful signals. Z-scoring holds onto more of that valuable information, which is why it does so well. Raw features just add noise, so they end up being the weakest choice.</p>

<p>Then, sector adjustment comes in and has an even bigger impact. Normalizing within sectors really improves Sharpe Ratios compared to global normalization. It makes sense because comparing stocks within the same sector gives us more relevant context. By normalizing within sectors, I’m making sure that sector-wide noise doesn’t interfere with the real signals, so the rankings are more stable.</p>

<p>Lastly, the target label is by far the most important factor. When I use Sharpe Ratios as the target, the models consistently perform better than when I use raw returns. This is no surprise—it’s easier to predict volatility than raw returns, so Sharpe Ratios give more reliable, risk-adjusted performance.</p>

<p>To sum it up, while normalization and sector adjustments matter, the key takeaway is the target label. Sharpe Ratios beat raw returns every time, and sector normalization makes the rankings a lot stronger.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ridge/summary_barplot.png" alt="Figure 4" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4</strong>: Sharpe Ratio performance across key modeling choices.</p>

<h3 id="normalization-effects-depend-on-the-target-label">Normalization Effects Depend on the Target Label</h3>

<p>Digging a little bit deeper, Figure 5 visualizes the effect of normalization conditioned on the target label.</p>

<p>For Return 20 models, normalization had a smaller effect, but ranking and Z-scoring still outperformed raw features. Interestingly, Z-scoring has regained popularity in recent years.</p>

<p>For Sharpe Ratio models, the impact of normalization was stronger. Z-scoring was clearly the best performer, followed by ranking, then raw features.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ridge/normalization_target.png" alt="Figure 5" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 5</strong>: Cumulative return of different normalization methods, conditioned on the target label. Volatility is set at 10% for all strategies.</p>

<h3 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Normalization improves signal stability, helping models generalize better.</li>
  <li>Sector-based adjustments on the target label refine comparisons, preventing large sector-specific biases.</li>
  <li>Target label choice affects robustness, with Sharpe Ratio-based models performing better.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-combo-strategy-holds-up-well">The “Combo” Strategy Holds Up Well</h2>

<p>I was surprised to see that the “Combo” strategy performed really well, coming in second for Sharpe ratio (you can see it in Table 1). Instead of picking just one top model, it weights all strategies equally—and still ended up second overall.</p>

<p>Even without fine-tuning, blending multiple models helped smooth the performance and made it more stable. It’s pretty clear to me that diversifying across models can outperform just sticking with a single “best” model.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1</strong>: Performance metrics across different modeling choices, ranked by Sharpe Ratio in descending order. Results exclude transaction costs and slippage.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Sector normalization (target label), normalization method, and target label choice all had a meaningful impact on performance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sector normalization was a game-changer—comparing stocks within their sector led to major improvements.</li>
  <li>Normalization method mattered more than expected—Z-scoring outperformed ranking, contradicting my initial intuition.</li>
  <li>Sharpe Ratio models consistently outperformed return-based models, reinforcing the importance of risk-adjusted metrics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of searching for a single best model, it may be smarter to combine perspectives. The “Combo” strategy showed that diversification across models stabilizes results—even without fine-tuning.</p>
