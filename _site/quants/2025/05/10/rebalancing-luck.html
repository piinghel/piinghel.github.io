    <p>Rebalancing timing plays a crucial role in medium- to long-term strategies that rely on binary signals and infrequent rebalancing. Shifting the execution day by even a few days can impact performance — affecting positions, returns, volatility, and drawdowns.</p>

<p>This issue is often referred to as <em>rebalance timing luck</em>: the variation in performance that comes purely from the day you happen to rebalance, even when the strategy and signals stay the same.</p>

<p>Others have explored this too. <a href="https://www.thinknewfound.com/rebalance-timing-luck">Newfound Research</a> wrote a great piece highlighting how impactful this effect can be. And the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5230603">Concretum Group</a> analyzed it in a GTAA context, showing that spreading rebalances out over time — instead of doing it all at once — can reduce timing risk and even lower turnover.</p>

<p>That got me curious: how much does timing luck affect my own long-short strategy? And could a more gradual rebalancing approach make it more stable, without changing the core logic?</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>The strategy is a long-short market-neutral model based on LightGBM predictions (see <a href="https://piinghel.github.io/quants/2025/02/20/lgbm.html">this earlier post</a>). It rebalances every three weeks, with the entire portfolio updated on a fixed weekday at the closing price. Since there are three possible starting weeks (offsets) and five weekdays, that gives us 15 possible rebalancing schedules.</p>

<p>I simulate all 15 combinations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 offsets × 5 weekdays = 15 setups</li>
  <li>Each uses the same trained model and applies predictions available on that specific day</li>
  <li>Signals, logic, and universe stay exactly the same</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, I compare this to a <em>tranching</em> setup — a common approach where the portfolio is divided into parts and rebalanced gradually. Here, the portfolio is split into three equal tranches. One-third is rebalanced each week, rotating through the offsets. Over three weeks, the full portfolio is still updated — just in smaller, smoother steps. This helps reduce sensitivity to any single day’s noise.</p>

<h2 id="rebalancing-day-does-matter">Rebalancing Day Does Matter</h2>

<p>Here’s the cumulative return of the 15 full-rebalance variants:</p>

<p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Performance metrics for each full-rebalance variant.</p>

<p>I expected more divergence between schedules, but returns ended up being fairly close — which was a bit surprising. Still, there’s meaningful variation: Sharpe ratios range from 1.50 to 1.75 for individual tranches, and time under water can differ by hundreds of days.</p>

<p>None of this comes from the model or the signal — it’s purely due to small shifts in rebalance timing that compound over time. Even when overall performance looks stable, this kind of noise makes it harder to tell whether a change is genuinely better or just lucky on timing.</p>

<h2 id="tranching-a-simple-effective-fix">Tranching: A Simple, Effective Fix</h2>

<p>Instead of picking a single rebalancing day, we can average across them.</p>

<p>In the tranching setup, I split the portfolio into three equal parts. Each week, I rebalance one-third of the portfolio — always on the same weekday (say, every Wednesday) — but each tranche follows a different offset within the three-week cycle. So over three weeks, the full portfolio is refreshed, just not all at once.</p>

<p>This staggered execution spreads risk more evenly across time without changing the model or signals.</p>

<p>To analyze the results, I group performance by weekday and average across the three offsets. This gives a cleaner comparison to the previous “all-at-once” setup.</p>

<p><strong>Table 2:</strong> Tranche-averaged performance by weekday.</p>

<p>The improvements aren’t massive, but they’re noticeable. Sharpe ratios rise into the 1.78–1.85 range, with Friday and Thursday performing best. Volatility tightens around 6.0%, and drawdowns are generally shallower and recover faster — especially compared to the more uneven results in individual tranches.</p>

<p>The gains aren’t just about higher returns — they mostly come from smoother execution. By spreading out rebalances, you avoid abrupt shifts in positioning, which leads to more stable performance and less noise.</p>

<p>From a research perspective, this helps a lot. It reduces the randomness from rebalance timing and makes it easier to spot whether a model improvement is real or just the result of good timing.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-works">Why It Works</h2>

<p>Tranching softens the impact of short-term shocks. A single full-book rebalance can pick up temporary price dislocations or liquidity gaps — injecting noise into an otherwise stable strategy. By spreading rebalancing over time, those effects average out.</p>

<p>The logic and signal stay exactly the same. The full portfolio still turns over every three weeks, just more gradually. That reduces sensitivity to any one day’s conditions, without changing overall turnover.</p>

<p>There’s also a subtle benefit on the signal side. In the standard setup, you only act on the model’s predictions once every three weeks. With tranching, you fold in new predictions each week — even if it’s only on a third of the capital. That introduces a kind of temporal diversification and makes the strategy more responsive to new information.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-trade-offs-and-extra-benefits">A Few Trade-Offs and Extra Benefits</h2>

<p>Tranching isn’t free. Weekly rebalancing means running the pipeline more often, sending more orders, and keeping an eye on execution regularly. That adds a bit of overhead — especially when some trades are small and barely move the portfolio.</p>

<p>But in practice, it’s felt worth it. Not just in research — even in live runs, it makes the strategy feel more stable and less twitchy around timing noise.</p>

<p>I also came across something interesting in the GTAA literature: tranching might reduce turnover and transaction costs. I’m not entirely sure why — maybe it avoids large shifts or cancels out trades across tranches. Still figuring that part out. If you’ve got ideas or experience with it, let me know — I’m curious.</p>

<p>And a small bonus: by updating just a slice each week, you keep injecting fresh signal without going all-in. The portfolio stays a bit more responsive without overtrading.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>What started as a small curiosity around rebalancing schedules turned into a strong case for using tranching by default.</p>

<p>The signal and logic don’t change — but the results become cleaner and more stable. That’s especially helpful when evaluating model tweaks, since it reduces noise from execution timing.</p>

<p>I’ll be using this setup going forward for any strategy that rebalances on a fixed cycle. It’s simple, effective, and makes the whole process easier to trust.</p>
